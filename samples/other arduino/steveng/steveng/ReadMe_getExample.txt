The code in these "get" Example uses an updated Nimbits library.  This is a simple example to pull data from the Nimbits cloud to an Arduino. For more information on Nimbits IoT visit www.nimbits.com

The example has been tested and run on an Arduino Mega. You will need a Nimbits account before using.

While it will compile and create a 24+k executable it hangs when it is run on an Uno, I suspect there is not enough room for the dynamic memory.
